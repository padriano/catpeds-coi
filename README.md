## Coefficient Of Inbreeding (COI or F) calculation for pedigrees

### Inbreeding

*In general terms, inbreeding is where the sire and dam have ancestors in common. The level of inbreeding is simply 
how closely related these relatives are across the sire and dam lines.*

*The standard (mathematical) measure for the level of inbreeding is the Inbreeding Co-efficient. 
It indicates the probability (between 0% and 100%) that genes at a randomly chosen location in the DNA are identical 
by descent. The technique assumes that there are 2 forms of a gene and that each form has an equal chance to be 
passed on to the next generation.*
